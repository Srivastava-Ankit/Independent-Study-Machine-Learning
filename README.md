# Descriptions
This project is able to classify the differnt points tapped by useres. Datasets contains signals of voltages for six differents sensors. 
when users tapped the poitns amoung the 6 different sensors, we have recorded the signals voltages for 6 different sensors. I have to used Decsion Tree classfier to classify the poitns.

After that, I have used different regression algorithms to get location (cooradinates) of points. I have used SVM, LinearSVM, Linear Regressaion algorithms. I got the best results with SVM regression algorithm.
